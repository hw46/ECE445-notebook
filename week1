Objective: Define Project Scope and Objectives
Record:

Main Ideas from Project Proposal:
Expanded on the need for an Item Retrieval Robotic Assistant to assist individuals with mobility challenges by reducing the physical effort required to retrieve items.

Diagrams and Schematics:

Developed detailed subsystem diagrams for the Power, Mechanical, and Control subsystems within both the Car System and Remote System.
Design Problems and Decisions:

Power Regulation: Determined the necessity for separate voltage regulation for servo motors and wheel motors to ensure stable performance.
Camera Integration: Decided to incorporate a real-time camera system for visual feedback, addressing the need for precise remote control.
Equations and Formulas:

Voltage Regulator Equation:
𝑉𝑜𝑢𝑡=𝑉𝑅𝐸𝐹×(1+𝑅2𝑅1)V out =V REF ×(1+ R1R2)Where 𝑉𝑅𝐸𝐹=1.25𝑉V REF =1.25V
Documentation of Testing and Debugging Process:

Researched suitable components for voltage regulation to match servo and wheel motor requirements.
Initiated voltage regulation calculations based on the LM1117 datasheet.
Important Notes for Debugging:

Ensure that voltage regulators can handle maximum current draw without overheating.
Incorporate thermal management solutions for high-power components to prevent failure.
Analysis and Proposed Solutions for Debugging Problems:

Evaluated potential issues with Bluetooth latency and planned to test real-time control responsiveness early in the development phase.
Documentation of New Tests:

Planned voltage output tests for selected regulators using breadboards to verify regulation accuracy.
Documentation of Final Performance Tests and Design Verification:

Scheduled subsystem integration tests for the upcoming weeks to verify overall system functionality.
