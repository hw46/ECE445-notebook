Objective: Fifth Round PCBway Orders and Sign-Up for Demonstrations
Record:

Main Ideas from Project Proposal:
Reinforced the importance of thorough testing and demonstration preparation to showcase the robotic assistant's capabilities and reliability during final presentations.

Bibliographic References:

Reviewed additional resources on advanced debugging techniques for PCBs to effectively identify and resolve any lingering issues.
Consulted presentation guidelines to enhance the effectiveness of upcoming demonstrations.
Diagrams and Schematics:

Submitted the Fifth Round PCBway Orders by 4:45 PM after passing the audit, incorporating all necessary design modifications based on previous testing feedback.
Design Problems and Decisions:

Servo Motor Overload: Identified that some servo motors were unable to handle the increased torque demands due to extended arm lengths. Decided to upgrade to higher-torque servo motors to meet performance requirements.
Power Distribution: Implemented an additional power supply channel dedicated to the upgraded servo motors to prevent overloading existing voltage regulators.
Equations and Formulas:

Power Distribution Equation:
Calculated the total power distribution to ensure that the additional servo motors are adequately powered without overloading existing systems.
𝑃𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙=𝑉×𝐼=7.8𝑉×1𝐴=7.8𝑊
Ensured that the new power supply channel can handle the additional 7.8W required by the upgraded servo motors.
Documentation of Testing and Debugging Process:

Signed up for Demonstration and Presentation sessions, ensuring that all team members are prepared to present their respective subsystems and functionalities.
Prepared materials for upcoming mock demonstrations, including updated presentation slides and demonstration scripts highlighting system capabilities and performance enhancements.
Coordinated with team members to ensure that all aspects of the robotic assistant are ready for demonstration, including power stability, servo motor performance, and remote control responsiveness.
Important Notes for Debugging:

Ensure that the upgraded servo motors are correctly integrated into the power subsystem to prevent voltage drops and maintain torque performance.
Verify that all demonstration materials accurately represent the system's capabilities and are free from technical inaccuracies.
Analysis and Proposed Solutions for Debugging Problems:

Detected that the upgraded servo motors were drawing more current than anticipated, causing voltage regulators to strain. Proposed adding a dedicated voltage regulator channel with higher current capacity to support the additional load.
Noted potential issues with servo motor overheating under extended operation and planned to implement additional cooling measures.
Documentation of New Tests:

Scheduled to perform comprehensive power distribution tests to ensure that the dedicated voltage regulator channel can handle the additional load without compromising system stability.
Planned to conduct extended servo motor operation tests to verify torque performance and thermal stability.
Documentation of Final Performance Tests and Design Verification:

Scheduled full system integration tests once the Fifth Round PCBs are received and assembled, ensuring that all subsystems operate harmoniously and meet design specifications.
Topic Outlines for Reports:

Updated the Final Performance Tests and Design Verification section, detailing the planned tests and expected outcomes to validate the robotic assistant's functionality and reliability.
