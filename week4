Objective: Soldering Assignment and Proposal Completion
Record:

Main Ideas from Project Proposal:
Highlighted the importance of precise soldering and PCB assembly to ensure reliable electrical connections and overall system stability.

Finalized the complete schematic for the Car System, integrating power regulation, motor control, and communication modules.

Voltage Regulation: Ensured that the LM1117 voltage regulators are correctly configured to provide the necessary voltages for servo and wheel motors without exceeding their maximum input voltage specifications.
Component Placement: Optimized PCB layout to minimize noise and interference between high-current motor drivers and sensitive microcontroller circuitry.

Verify that all solder joints are secure and free from bridges to prevent short circuits.
Use thermal paste or heat sinks on voltage regulators if operating near their maximum thermal limits.
Analysis and Proposed Solutions for Debugging Problems:

Planned to simulate the Car System's power regulation on a breadboard to verify stability before final PCB assembly.
Documentation of Final Performance Tests and Design Verification:

Scheduled comprehensive testing of the power subsystem post-assembly to ensure reliable voltage outputs under load.
Topic Outlines for Reports:

Outlined the Design Alternatives section, preparing to discuss potential issues with motor drivers and voltage regulators, and the solutions implemented.
