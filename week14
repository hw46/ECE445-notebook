Objective: Fall Break
Record:

Main Ideas from Project Proposal:
Utilized the Fall Break period for individual study and preparation, ensuring all team members are well-prepared for the final stages of the project upon return.

Reviewed additional technical resources on firmware optimization and power management to prepare for final system enhancements post-Fall Break.
Diagrams and Schematics:

No new diagrams or schematics were developed during Fall Break.
Design Problems and Decisions:

Project Continuity: Decided to use Fall Break as a period for finalizing documentation and preparing for the final demonstration, ensuring no project momentum is lost.
Equations and Formulas:

No new equations or formulas were developed during Fall Break.
Documentation of Testing and Debugging Process:

No active testing or debugging was conducted during Fall Break. Team members reviewed past test results and identified areas requiring attention upon return.
Important Notes for Debugging:

Plan to implement additional cooling measures for servo motors if overheating issues persist during final tests.
Ensure all firmware optimizations are fully integrated and tested post-Fall Break to enhance system responsiveness.
Analysis and Proposed Solutions for Debugging Problems:

Anticipated the need for further firmware optimizations to handle increased servo motor loads and prevent latency issues.
Proposed conducting a full system diagnostic upon return to identify and address any residual issues before the final demonstration.
Documentation of New Tests:

Planned to resume comprehensive system integration and performance testing immediately after Fall Break.
Documentation of Final Performance Tests and Design Verification:

Scheduled to finalize all performance tests post-Fall Break, ensuring the system operates reliably under all specified conditions.
Topic Outlines for Reports:

No new report outlines were developed during Fall Break. Team members focused on reviewing and refining existing report sections to ensure completeness and accuracy.
