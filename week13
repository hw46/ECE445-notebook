Objective: Mock Demonstration
Record:

Main Ideas from Project Proposal:
Highlighted the importance of conducting mock demonstrations to identify and rectify potential issues before the final presentation, ensuring a smooth and successful showcase of the robotic assistant's capabilities.

Reviewed additional resources on effective demonstration techniques to enhance the clarity and impact of the mock demo.
Consulted troubleshooting guides for common servo motor issues to prepare for potential challenges during the demonstration.
Diagrams and Schematics:

Prepared the final Design Document excerpts for the mock demonstration, ensuring all subsystem details and design considerations are accurately presented.
Design Problems and Decisions:

Servo Motor Torque: Identified that the upgraded servo motors were insufficient to handle the increased torque demands during the demonstration. Decided to further upgrade to even higher-torque servo motors to meet performance requirements.
Power Stability: Noted that the power supply was experiencing minor fluctuations during extended servo motor operation and decided to implement additional capacitors to enhance voltage stability.

Confirmed that the upgraded servo motors provide at least 1.961Nm, exceeding the required torque by a margin to ensure reliable performance.
Documentation of Testing and Debugging Process:

Conducted a mock demonstration during the weekly TA meeting, showcasing the robotic arm's item retrieval and transportation capabilities.
Observed issues with servo motor responsiveness and power stability during the demonstration, leading to the identification of necessary design adjustments.
Documented all issues encountered, including delayed servo responses and voltage fluctuations, and discussed potential solutions with team members.
Important Notes for Debugging:

Ensure that all servo motors are adequately cooled during extended operations to prevent thermal throttling.
Verify that the additional capacitors are correctly placed near voltage regulators to maximize their effectiveness in stabilizing voltage supply.
Analysis and Proposed Solutions for Debugging Problems:

Determined that the current PWM signal generation method was insufficient for handling rapid and simultaneous servo motor commands. Proposed implementing interrupt-driven PWM signal generation to enhance responsiveness.
Identified that the power supply's capacity was marginally insufficient for the upgraded servo motors and proposed integrating a secondary power supply channel to distribute the load more effectively.
Documentation of New Tests:

Scheduled to implement and test the interrupt-driven PWM signal generation in the firmware to improve servo motor responsiveness.
Planned to perform extensive power stability tests with the additional capacitors to ensure voltage fluctuations are minimized during high-load operations.
Documentation of Final Performance Tests and Design Verification:

Scheduled comprehensive system integration tests post-mock demonstration to validate all design enhancements and ensure readiness for the final demonstration.
Topic Outlines for Reports:

Updated the Conclusion section to include insights gained from the mock demonstration, detailing the issues encountered and the solutions implemented to enhance system performance and reliability.
